# select

Sometimes we have a single goroutine listening to multiple channels and want to process data in the order it comes through each channel.

A select statement is used to listen to multiple channels at the same time. It is similar to a switch statement but for channels.

```go
select {
case i, ok := <- chInts:
    fmt.Println(i)
case s, ok := <- chStrings:
    fmt.Println(s)
}
```

The first channel with a value ready to be received will fire and its body will execute
If multiple channels are ready at the same time one is chosen randomly
